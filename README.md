# Morse-Code-Responder
This is an Arduino based project that sends Morse Code messages (time and random messages) to a telegraph sounder.
Time is sent on the hour with two Morse Code characters representing the hour in military time (00-23).
The random messages will be sent ten seconds after a user stops tapping the telegraph key.   The messages are
short and meant to entertain as well as teach Morse Code.    The pdf conists of detailed descriptions of 
both the hardware (including schematics) and the software as well as some develpment history.
